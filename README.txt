run install.bat to copy compressXvid to system directory and install all registry files

to uninstall, run uninstall bat, it deletes the compressXvid from system root and removes all registry files

i've kept deprecated registry files for future reference for myself, but they are unnecessary

HOW TO USE:
after running install.bat, right click any video->"compress video"->choose option you want
NOTE:
For some reason you must speed up or slow down BEFORE compressing, it degrades video otherwise
